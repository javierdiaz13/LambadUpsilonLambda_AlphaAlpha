        <p class="gold-section-header">Our Philosophy</p>
        <p class="gold-section-text">The brothers of LUL are strong believers in shaping our own destiny. What separates us from the rest is our ability to inspire greatness in others. We have a remarkable work ethic that allows a small group of men to achieve the impossible, but more importantly create a unique family that we can return to years after. We are small, diverse, and tight knit, but we are not close minded or exclusive.</p>

        <p class="gold-section-text">“The brothers of LUL continually strive for excellence in all they do both on and off campus. Some of our strongest and most involved student leaders are brothers of LUL and our office holds them to the highest of standards. They strive to make an impact on the Stevens community through service, leadership in a wide array of campus organizations, and in celebrating their values and culture.”</p>

        <p class="gold-section-text">“LUL men are wonderful examples and role models to other men on this campus and those who aspire to become college students. This chapter understands how to support not only the members of their fraternity, but other organizations on this campus. I often refer to them as the glue that binds the chapters on this campus. Whether taking leadership roles in freshmen orientation, residence life, or within the community, they leave their positive imprint behind wherever they go. I am proud of this group of men and will continue to expect this level of performance from them for years to come”</p>
